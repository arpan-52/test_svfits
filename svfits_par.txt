*
* 18/Apr/25 inputs for svfits version 0.93, including computation of the
* postcorrelation beam. The inputs here were tested with the PSR0329+54
* data taken on 01/01/2025.
*
* 19/Apr/25 added options for separately doing bandpass correction and off
* source subtraction (were combined into DO_BAND earlier) and also added
* choice of number of threads for newly added parallel sections, option of
* dropping CSQ baselines while making the post-corr beam
