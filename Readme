Updated code which now seems to be working correctly, provided the correct burst
time is given. (The provided burst time appeared to be wrong, so for testing,
the burst time estimated directly from the 1.3ms raw visibility files was used).
The FITS file loads properly, can be imaged, self-calibrated etc. Code has also
been made a lot cleaner, and documentation added. There is now the option for
make a post correlation beam using the raw visiblities themselves, which can be
a useful diagnostic.


Some details on the files in this commit are given below.

antsamp.hdr - No change

fitsio.h  No change

longnam.h No Change

makefile No change

newcorr.h No change

plot_flagged.py  python function to show the number of visibilities flagged per baseline

plot_postcorr.py python function to plot the post correlation beam data computed by svfits. The data selected as containing the burst can also be read from the svfits.log file and overplotted.

Readme -- this file.

read_rawvis.py no change

stats.c -- No change

svfits.c -- significant rewrite of the main function, where we now process the visibility files one slice (i.e. 50 continuous records) at a time. This has made it possible to have much more modular code. Also added several more options, including the option to make the post-correlation beam, which is a useful diagnostic. The python program plot_postcorr.py reads the generated beam data, along with the svfits log file, to show the post correlation beam as well as the data identified as containing the burst.

svfits_par.txt -- added the parameters related to the added options in svfits.c.

svio.h -- changes to accommodate the added options to svfits.

svsubs.c -- significant rewrite, to make the code much more modular. The main changes are that we now process one slice at a time, and there is also the option to compute the postcorrelation beam.

utils.c -- No change
