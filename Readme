Working on getting the coordinates correct. This continues to be work in progress. The current version uses the novasc library for positional astronomy instead of the starlink sla library (which is no longer maintained). Code for rotating the visibilties to a new phase centre as well as computing the post-correlation beam after rotation to the new centre has been added. Testing is *still incomplete*

Some details on the files in this commit are given below.

stats.c -- No change

SVFITS.md  updated to reflect new/unused parameters.

svfits.c -- modified to force coordinates to J2000 and use novasc instead of SLA

svfits_par.txt -- updated to include RECENTRE parameter which controls whether phase centre is to be shifted.

svio.h -- small changes corresponding to the new options in svfits.

svsubs.c -- continuing work on getting the coordinates correct. This version uses novasc instead of sla and also forces the coordinates to J2000 (user input is ignored). Also has an option for changing the phasecentre.

utils.c -- No change
