Working on getting the coordinates correct using offset observations B0329+54. Part of the problem was traced to the fact that the mjd_ref for the vispar file is different than the mjd_ref for the observation (unlike the case for lta files). Fixed this but there still may be more problems. Also parallelized the computations for ALL_DATA, which has speeded things up significantly.

Some details on the files in this commit are given below.

antsamp.hdr - No change

fitsio.h  No change

longnam.h No Change

makefile No change

newcorr.h No change

plot_flagged.py  No change

plot_postcorr.py added making a plot of the de-dispersed time series and showing the burse-time given by the trigger software, and other minor changes.

Readme -- this file.

read_rawvis.py minor changes to the way the plots are titled.

stats.c -- No change

SVFITS.md  markdown file with some user docummentation

svfits.c -- printing out the version to 2 decimal digits now.

svfits_par.txt -- updated to include the parameters to allow for all of the data to be converted to fits (ALL_DATA,NCHAV)

svio.h -- small changes corresponding to the new options in svfits.

svsubs.c -- work on correcting the mjd_ref, this has improved the coordinate match for offset sources, but there may still be a residual error. Also parallelized the computations in the ALL_DATA case.

utils.c -- No change
