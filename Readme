More testing and debugging done on the J2000 coordiates, rotation of UVW etc and this version appears to be more or less correct. Still more testing is needed, however. There may be issues related to UTC->UT1. This version also includes reading in of the binary corr and scan headers. However currently the Das pipeline appears to be filling wrong/incomplete information in these headers, so until that is resolved, one needs to seprately provide all of the meta data in the svfits_par.txt file. Will handle both the new format (where the file index is embeded) as well as the old format (without the file index) raw visibility files.

Some details on the files in this commit are given below.

antsamp.hdr - No change

fitsio.h  No change

gmrt_newcorr.h replaces newcorr.h. This is to be in sync with the online version, which unfortunately started the tradition of having closely related but not identical header files for the online and offline software.

longnam.h No Change

makefile No change

newcorr.h  Dropped instead we now have gmrt_newcorr.h

novascon.h header file for NOVASC

novas.h    header file for NOVASC

nutation.h header file for NOVASC

plot_flagged.py  No change

plot_postcorr.py No change

Readme -- this file.

read_rawvis.py No change. This needs to be updated to reflect the fact that the raw visibility files now have the index embeded in them.

solarsystem.h Header file for NOVASC

stats.c -- No change

SVFITS.md  updated to reflect changes.

svfits.c -- changes associated with reading in meta-data from the binary header files (-b option) etc. The binary header is work in progress.

svfits_par.txt -- updated to include HAVE_IDX and N_SLICE options.

svio.h -- small changes corresponding to the new options in svfits.

svsubs.c -- J2000 coordinates and relocating the phase centre seem to now be more or less correct. Needs more testing. There may be issues with UTC->UT1 that need to be resolved.
