fixed a bug where some of the FITS header parameters (OBSERVER, TITLE) were not initialized by default. Also made some changes to try and ensure that the output FITS file is in Time-Baseline order, regardless of the order of the input visibility files. (Works, but needs a some more generalization for the case in which more than one slice from a given raw visibility files contains the signal).
