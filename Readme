This is the initial commit of the program to convert SPOTLIGHT raw 1.3ms visibility dump files into a random group FITS file. The code reuses many routines from gvfits.

Some details on the files in this commit are given below.

-- antsamp.hdr - File containing the antenna parameters (positions, delays, etc) as well as the sampler to antenna connection map. It is in the same format as the files used by the online data acquisition chain, which allows for a reuse of the code that parses these files. This is for use during testing, the intention is that in the pipeline mode, this data will be obtained from a binary dump of the corr and scan structures.

-- fitsio.h main header file for cfitsio

-- longnam.h header file for cfitsio

-- makefile the makefile, library paths are set for dandelion, and would need to be modified accordingly.

--newcorr.h the header file containing the structures used by both the online data acquisition chain and the offline programs (lute, gvfits, etc.). This is the version in use in March 2025, as obtained from Sanjay Kudale. A number of comments have been added to the file to help guide future developers.

Readme -- this file.

stats.c -- program that computes various statistics needed for the MAD based flagging. Code reused from flagcal.

svfits.c -- the main program for conversion of the raw visibilities to fits. Converts the data itself, and also generates the main header of the FITS file as well as the associated tables.

svfits_par.txt -- user supplied parameters. Most of these parameters are expected to be generated from the meta data available in the SPOTLIGHT pipeline. For testing these have to be generated by hand.

svio.h -- header file containing structures used for converting from the raw visibility format to the random group format, including structures for mapping the input to output baseline order, the burst parameters, translating the meta data, etc.

svsubs.c -- various functions that are used by svfits.c

utils.c -- these are basic utilities for conversion from LittleEndian to BigEndian, date conversion, etc. All are taken from the existing code gvfits.c/csubs1.c/corrsub.c etc.
