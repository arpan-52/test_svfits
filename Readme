Added parallelization of the more time consuming parts of the code (make_postcorr and make_bpass) also fixed a bug in normalizing the amplitude bandpass in make_bpass. Separated out removing the off source baseline and applying the amplitude bandpass. Now the user can use either one or both or none.
